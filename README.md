## Hi I'm Jake <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

Hello! My name is Jake Kinchen and I am a **full stack developer** with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development. I am proficient in creating user-friendly and responsive web applications using React and its ecosystem, and I have a passion for problem-solving and continual learning.

My journey into software and web development began with leading group projects to develop full-stack applications at **LSU**. This experience provided a solid foundation in development, teamwork, and project management, all while cultivating my passion for creating visually stunning and user-focused products.

My career took an exciting turn when I joined **OneTier**. Here, I discovered the transformative potential of Language Learning Models (LLMs) in automating microservices and enhancing productivity. I saw first-hand how LLMs can provide unparalleled efficiency and accuracy in tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, and language translation, which are invaluable for businesses seeking to streamline operations and improve their services.
