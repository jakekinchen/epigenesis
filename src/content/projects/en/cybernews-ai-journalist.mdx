## Technical Implementation

The project is built using a modern tech stack that includes:

```python
# Example of the news processing pipeline
class NewsProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = initialize_llm()
        self.scraper = DataScraper()
        self.image_gen = DALLE3Generator()
    
    async def process_article(self, url):
        # Fetch raw content
        content = await self.scraper.fetch_content(url)
        
        # AI analysis
        analysis = self.llm.analyze(content)
        
        # Generate relevant image
        image = await self.image_gen.create_image(analysis.summary)
        
        # Format for WordPress
        post = self.format_for_wordpress(analysis, image)
        
        return post
```
